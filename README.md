# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-on-UsedCarDataset-using-Python
Introduction:

The used car market is a significant segment of the automotive industry, providing affordable vehicle options to a wide range of consumers. With the rise of online marketplaces and data-driven decision-making, understanding the factors that influence used car prices has become more critical than ever. This project aims to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of used cars to uncover insights that can help buyers, sellers, and businesses make informed decisions.

The dataset includes various features such as the car's age, kilometers driven, mileage, engine size, power, and more. By analyzing these features, we aim to identify patterns and relationships that can explain variations in used car prices. This analysis will also help in understanding the impact of different attributes on the valuation of used cars.

Problem Statement:

The primary objective of this project is to explore and analyze the used car dataset to identify key factors that affect the price of used cars. Specifically, we aim to:

-Identify correlations between different features such as car age, kilometers driven, mileage, engine size, power, and price.

-Determine the impact of each feature on the price of used cars.

-Handle missing data and perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accurate analysis.

-Provide visualizations that effectively communicate the findings and insights derived from the data.

-Develop a predictive model to estimate the price of a used car based on its attributes.
